# User guide EasySave
## Presentation
This is a user guide on the features of the EasySave app.
The main purpose of this application is to duplicate files to another location and allow a simplified update of the saved file.
The current version of EasySave has 5 configurable slots.

## 1. Navigate on the software

To navigate through the different options of the application, you must type one of the numbers corresponding to the options displayed.

## 2. Exit the software
It is possible to exit the application at any time by typing 'q'.

## 3. Select a language

The language is selected when opening the application, you must type the number corresponding to the desired language.

## 4. See and interact with the save slots

The main display shows the 5 slots that are or are not used. 

A single slot can be selected by entering its corresponding digit.
Multiple slots can be selected by entering their numbers spaced by a ";"
(e.g. 1;3;4 will select slots 1, 3 and 4)

## 5. Empty slots

A selected empty location must be configured with the source file to duplicate and the destination path where that file will be duplicated.
If the source file does not exist or a wrong destination is entered, then the process is aborted and you have to start again.

## 6. Non-empty slots

One or more selected non-empty slots can be deleted, or they can be run again and update the associated file(s).

## 7. Logs
The logs allow to have a history of the backups made with the application. 
The log stores general information such as:
- The size of the file
- The source file path
- The date the backup is made
...

New information is added at the end of the single log file with each slot update. Nothing is added when doing another action such as deleting a slot.
